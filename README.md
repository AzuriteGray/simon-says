# Simons Keyboard



## UX

I have designed the keyboard closly to one that i used to own myself hoping to make sure its easily
recognizable and to make sure people can identify what it is without spending to much time looking at it.



## Features

- the option to choose how many keys are in use between 4 and 7
- the color coding of the keys
- diffrent sound effects per key

## Technologies used

I have used google fonts for the font used inside of the display

other than that its all base html, css and javascript


## Testing

for testing purposes i have had several of my family members and friends play it to help me find bugs.
I have also ran all my code trough diffrent validators to make sure that they where written in a proper way.

## Deployment

I have live deployed my project only on GitHub at https://azuritegray.github.io/simon-says/Ã¤
there is no diffrences between the develepoment and the deployed version of the website
