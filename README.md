# Simons Keyboard

after playing numerous simon says games i came to the conclusion that they where all to similar and to easy, 
so i set out to make something harder with a slightly diffrent look to it while keeping the base game the same.
The reason behind using a keyboard was quite simple becasue quite like simon says you have keys that make noise
except there is more of them wich can be used to in crease the difficulty. To ensure it is still fun for everyone
i made it so that you can choose the amount of notes you would like to use so it can be like normal simon says
with just for keys or quite a bit harder with 7 notes.

## UX

Main goal, keep it simple looking and straight forward. you can tell what button does what by looking at it
the keyboard is modeld after a real keyboard just one octave instead of seven.

Most players are familiar with the game of simon says. i have had several friends and family members
test the game for me to give feedback on the looks and gameplay to make sure it was pleasing to the eye
and make sure there was nothing too confusing in it.
