# Simons Keyboard

after playing numerous simon says games i came to the conclusion that they where all to similar and to easy, 
so i set out to make something harder with a slightly diffrent look to it while keeping the base game the same.
The reason behind using a keyboard was quite simple becasue quite like simon says you have keys that make noise
except there is more of them wich can be used to in crease the difficulty. To ensure it is still fun for everyone
i made it so that you can choose the amount of notes you would like to use so it can be like normal simon says
with just for keys or quite a bit harder with 7 notes.

## UX

I have designed the keyboard closly to one that i used to own myself hoping to make sure its easily
recognizable and to make sure people can identify what it is without spending to much time looking at it.



## Features

- the option to choose how many keys are in use between 4 and 7
- the color coding of the keys
- diffrent sound effects per key

## Technologies used

I have used google fonts for the font used inside of the display

other than that its all base html, css and javascript


## Testing

for testing purposes i have had several of my family members and friends play it to help me find bugs.
I have also ran all my code trough diffrent validators to make sure that they where written in a proper way.

## Deployment

I have live deployed my project only on GitHub at https://azuritegray.github.io/simon-says/Ã¤
there is no diffrences between the develepoment and the deployed version of the website
